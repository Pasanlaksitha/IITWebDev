# Project GAIA: Wildlife Conservation at WILD TRAILS - Hotel & Spa

Welcome to Project GAIA by WILD TRAILS - Hotel & Spa, situated alongside the mesmerizing Yala National Park. As champions of sustainability, we are deeply committed to fostering a harmonious relationship between humans and wildlife.

At the heart of Project GAIA lies our advanced Wildlife Vet Clinic, dedicated to ensuring the well-being of the park's diverse fauna. Our mission extends beyond medical care; we are passionate about educating the public on wildlife conservation. Seasonal volunteer opportunities allow participants to engage hands-on, from assisting in our vet clinic to immersive wildlife tours.

Support our cause by exploring our curated range of merchandise at our on-site shop, featuring volunteer t-shirts, safari-themed apparel, eco-friendly bags, and more. Every purchase directly contributes to our conservation efforts.

Check out our online gallery to witness our conservation journey through captivating images of our vet clinic, rescue operations, beach cleanups, and the dedicated volunteers who drive our mission forward.
